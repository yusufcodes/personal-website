                <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                <p>I am a 19 year old student, born and raised in Manchester.</p>
                <p>I like keeping up with the latest tech news, watching TV series and some football here and there as well. </p>

            <div class="col">
                <h2>What am I passionate about?</h2>
                <p>I want to be able to help other people in the best way I can, using the skills I am continually gaining from my degree and things done in my spare time. This is essentially the reason why I enjoy programming and development - I have the power to make a positive difference to people's lives. </p>

            <div class="col">
                <h2>What am I currently doing?</h2>
                <p>I'm currently studying my second year of Computer Science where I'm building on my knowledge from first year and learning some new things (see portfolio below).</p>
                <p>In my spare time, I'm enhancing my knowledge of front end web development. I started off with HTML and CSS, and now understanding the basics of the two, I am delving deeper into the world of JavaScript. I am using a Udemy course to further my knowledge of JS.</p>
